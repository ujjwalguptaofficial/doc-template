IDBStudio is a helper tool for jsstore development. It helps users to execute , debug and learn jsstore query.

Imagine you are in a situation where -

* You dont know what query will be used to get the perfect result.
* You have a big database & you want to work on optimization of query.
* You are experimenting with database format.
* You want to learn jsstore & want to experiment something.
* You want to inspect database - tables, columns etc.
  
<br>
With all of these situations - you end up creating an application & executing queries through console or taking help of browser debugging tools. 

IDBStudio helps you with these situations and let you speed up your development.
