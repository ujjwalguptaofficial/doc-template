A database in JsStore is array of tables.

```
var database = {
    name: "database name",
    tables: [table1, table2, table3]
}
```

Now you have successfully defined Database, lets create the database in browser.

JsStore executes everything in worker. So we need to supply worker instance for initiating the jsstore.

```
var connection = new JsStore.Instance(new Worker('jsstore worker location'));
connection.createDb(Database);
```

When Db is already created. You can open the connection using **openDb**.

**Note :-** 'createDb' api is time consuming, so when you have already created database - it is recommended to use 'openDb'.

```
var connection = new JsStore.Instance(new Worker('jsstore worker location'));
connection.openDb(Database_Name);
```

JsStore provides **isDbExist** api to check whether database is created or not.

```
connection.isDbExist(db_name).then(function(isExist) {
    console.log(isExist);
});
```

So if we will wrap above concept, we can use below code to initiate database.

```
var connection = new JsStore.Instance(new Worker('jsstore.worker.js'));
connection.isDbExist(db_name).then(function(isExist) {
    if (isExist) {
        Connection.openDb(db_name);
    } else {
        Connection.createDb(Database);
    }
}).catch(function(err) {
    //this will be fired when indexedDB is not supported.
    alert(err.message);
});
```

**Note :-**  

*   You dont need to open the db multiple times. Declare it one time at page load and use it always.
*   At a time one db can be handled by one jsstore instance. So if you want to open multiple db, create multiple instance.
