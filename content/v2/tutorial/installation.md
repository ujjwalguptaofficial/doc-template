In order to set up jsstore - you need two files - 
* jsstore - It contains all apis code and need to be included directly in html file.
* jsstore.worker.js - It contains all logic and can be used as worker or without worker.
If you want dont want to use as worker - you can just include in html page just like other scripts.
